## Projects
### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Superstore Data
[Publication](https://github.com/AloRay/TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS-AND-FORECASTING-SUPERSTORE-DATA)

This project analyzes and forecasts Superstore sales data, focusing on furniture and office supplies categories. This project aims to analyze Superstore sales data and forecast future sales for furniture and office supplies. It identifies seasonal patterns, trends and predicts future sales using ARIMA and Facebook's Prophet models.

### Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

This project focuses on building a fraud detection model for credit card transactions using a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. We are working with a highly unbalanced dataset and the challenge lies in effectively detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. I utilized decision tree, svc, smote-oversampler, sgdclassifier, k-neighbors-classifier, etc. in developing this model.

###  Gas Price Forecasting
[Publication](https://github.com/AloRay/GAS-PRICE-FORECASTING)

This repository utilizes time series analysis to predict natural gas prices, aiding informed decisions in the energy market. Through meticulous data preprocessing, visualization, and ARIMA modeling, it provides accurate forecasts. With regression and interpolation techniques, it offers deeper insights for stakeholders, enabling proactive strategies. I also utilized linear regression, bilinear interpolation, mean square error, mean absolute error root, mean square error, etc. for analysis and forecasting.
